## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Model groups with auto-failover (Phase 1)**
  - New optional `model_group` field on models — when set, multiple models sharing a group form a LiteLLM failover group
  - `get_models_for_litellm()` in `db.py` now transforms `model_group` into LiteLLM's `model_name`, with prefix applied if configured
  - `PATCH /api/models/{name}` accepts `model_group` for per-model assignment
  - `GET/POST /api/settings/router` — expose `routing_strategy`, `allowed_fails`, and `num_retries`
  - Group badge displayed in model rows in the UI
  - Inline group-name input in the model detail section
  - New Router Settings section in the Models page (strategy, fails, retries)
  - Backward compatible — models without `model_group` behave identically to before
- **docs/ROADMAP.md** — full 8-phase development roadmap
- **docs/CHANGELOG.md** — this file
